        <h3>Our project</h3>
        GET HEALTH is a set of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and is published on at least one web server. But this version is a trial version only for testing, and the information on this page is the responsibility of the owner of the information.
        <h3>central programming</h3>
        Software is so central to the functioning of our technology it's impossible to imagine the modern world without all those lines of code instructing machines (and increasingly humans) what to do when, and often how.
